Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing
Open Source Day

Nearly everyone working on this project today is new to the project and many 
of us are new to open source too! To start off, Rachel explained to us the 
project aims. The goal is to create a system so that women in Haiti can call
and leave voice messages on the system and the voice messages will get sent
to everyone in the database.

We plan to use contact data from an existing network called Fonekoze 
(english pronounciation: "phone-ko-zay"). Fonekoze is a microfinance network
that has a database of women, and the database will soon contain their phone
numbers.

There is a group of students in Haiti who recently did an internship where they
wrote a java application that is a prototype for allowing users to post their phone
numbers to the database. We had a conference call where we got to meet each other
and they talked us through the application.

We put the java application on a git repository and set up maven to compile it.
This will allow everyone to have access to the same source code and the same 
method of compilation.

Ryan, Trish, Adrian, and Bonnie worked on the text-to-speech component using
twilio. Leah stayed in touch with the ladies in Haiti, helped get them 
onboard using git and maven, and explained the features we're adding.

Another feature to add is accepting voice messages from members, converting them
to text, and posting them to the database where they can reach everybody in 
the network.
